Moving right along to the next challenge.
First I read the instructions that just seem to keep lying to me in Image 1. I have learned not to trust manuels now.
So to start off in Image 2 I tried a password that is exactly 16 characters to see what would happen. 
Did not seee anything of interest, so I moved on. 
But, not before I saw that they did not move the password away from the memory for instructions. 
I had a felling that I could try something like before.
I tried a 4 different 4532 with 7f00 at the end, since 7f00 is the interupt command 
and 4532 is the instruction for interupts and added 4532 at the end to get that to be where I go. 
In Image 3 you see what it looks like in the memory when I forget to say that it is hex.
As you can see in Image 4, I was right to think that because the sp is already unlocking the door in that image.
Once I input that as the password in hex, it works.
