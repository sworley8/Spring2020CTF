# VIPCTF
CTF done for VIP ESCS in Spring 2020 (May 2020 to be specific)
CTF done for Mircocorruption and Cryptopals

Mircocorruption:
   So, the order of the challenges were as followed for me:
      New Orleans, Syndey, Hanoi, Cusco, Reykjavik, Johannesburg,
      Whitehorse, Santa Cruz, Montevideo, Addis Ababa, Jakarta
      
Cryptopals:
   Since the ctf did not specify what programming language to use, I choose python.
