Now we are moving onto the next challenge.
As always, Image 1-2 show the changes to the lock. From what I understood the lock now has no true password and must pass a conditional to open.
First part that I noticed is that the password is required to be between 8-16 characters. 
Firstly, I test what the system does when the password is correct, which is shown from Images 3-13. 
I did not get alot of information from it. 
I looked at testing_password_valid to be sure that is where I could learn the most from assembly code. 
Overall not helpful with a password that is in the bounds, and a bust trying to figure it out.
Image 14-15 was me testing to see how the characters lined up when was exactly 16 characters.
Next I did a password too long like ASDFGHJKLKKHGFDASDFGHJKLLHGFDSA, which is more than 16 characters in Image 16.
Image 17 shows that we were able to pass the validity. However, in Image 18 we see there is a comparitor that exists.
So in Image 19, we add the value that was being compared to the end of the 16 characters and are able to pass.
