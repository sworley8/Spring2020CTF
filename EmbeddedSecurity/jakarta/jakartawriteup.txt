Now we are at the last challenge I did.
Image 1 is the instructions, which we all know lie.
Moving on, Image 2 was me figuring out where the door was at address 4442. 
So then I noticed that protocol calls strcpy before asking for a password, which is interesting in Image 3; 
it also does login and strcpy before verify that it is valid as shown in Image 4. 
It also asks for me to make sure both username and password are 32 characters long when put together. 
Great way to tell me that I should break it by not doing that. 
Image 5 showed me that there is a comparision to see if the value is more than 32 characters. 
So I decide to make the username 16 characters and the password to be an insane amount as shown in Images 6-8. 
I only input the 4442 as the username and password. 
As I go through it I realize that since Image 5 shows that one of the values must be 32 characters then the other can be as long as I want, so the username ends up being 4442 16 times and the password was more tricky. 
Image 10 was me testing different amounts to see what would work. 
Until I realized I needed a really large number something like 100 or more. 
So I used python to print the amount I wanted, going from 100-112 I would use this call in python and the print it as my password: Print (‘4c44’ * 112). Then I got to Image 11 which was the answer for the password.
