The first real challenge is New Orleans. I am ignoring the tutorial, since it is just a tutorial.
Image 1 tells you about the lock. In reality, there is nothing special about this instruction set, and it is the base that all the others later on are based on.
So in looking at the assembly code, I see marked as blue in Image 2 a check password.
I make a break statement there and in Image 3 input my test password to see how the system works.
In image 4, at the check password point there is the password I put in test and at line 2400 there is some hex codes.
I get curious and look to see in the code where it accesses that part.
Before that I want to see what happens with my password im currently testing.
I see in image 5 that the registers r13 and r15 are used. 
Then in image 8, I look at what was originally put into r13 which is 2400. 
I see in image 9 that I go through each part of what is r13 to compare with r15 and see if it works; while using r14 as the incrementor. When I put the password in like in Image 7, 
I am able to get to Image 11 vs putting test as the password will get me to Image 6. So the password is at 2400.
