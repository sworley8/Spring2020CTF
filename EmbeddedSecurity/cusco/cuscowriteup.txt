Next up is Cusco.
So Image 1 is the instruction. In it it says that the makers of the lock realized they hadnt fixed the conditional if the password was too long and have now fixed it.
First thing I did was check testing_password_valid to see if anything had changed and it hadn't. 
I checked what the procedure did when I inputted the password in Image 2, and as I went through it as shown in Image 3-5, 
I realized that testingctf was not seperated from the memory with the instructions in it as shown in Image 6.
Since testing_password_valid wasn't changed, I put in another password longer than 16 characters as shown in Image 7.
Image 8 shows that I broke the system, which is great because it meant they fixed nothing.
So all I had to do was figure out how to force it to go where I wanted and also figure out where I wanted to go. 
Image 9 is me showing you where I decided to go. 
The address of it was 4528, so I just put that in as the key and see if it would work as shown in Image 10. 
Image 11 shows that it did not work and I felt dumb when that happened.
I literally forgot the endianess, which is shown in Image 12. 
I put in the correct endianess for the address in Image 14 and Image 15 shows that it jumps to the address I wanted. 
Lastly Image 16 shows that I cracked the lock and finished the challenege.
