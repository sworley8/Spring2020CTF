Moving onto the next challenge. 
So, this was one of the hardest for me, because I got stuck and could not figure out how the memory played into everything.

So, to begin the instructions state that they fixed the locks to be harder to figure out this time.
Immediatley I looked at main and found that it makes a call to enc, which in my head means encrypt.
I look over there to see what will happen when I put a password in. Image 2-7 is me showing that. 
Image 3-4 shows that something is occuring specifically at 247c, 
but looking at the memory at that spot either time shows nothing there. 
Image 5-7 is where the calls goes back to after everything that occurs. 
At this point, I am confused. I know something is happening at 247c, but I dont see anything.
I eventually looked at other's solutions to find out I needed to use a deamssembler to get through the memory.
https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2018/03/06/microcorruption---reykjavik/ <-- was what I looked at to find that out.
I quickly scroll through and see white which surprises me since the whole program is grey and green.
I look at what they said there. It turns out that the memory is where the instructions I am looking for lie.
Image 8 is showing the exact memory that has the instructions in it. 
I go to a deassembler and see the instructions, as shown in Image 9.
Image 10 is a comparision, which has normally meant something interesting is going on.
Image 11-12 was me focusing more on the call function and working with that, but I did not get anywhere with that.
I inputted the value that it was being compared to in Image 13. I forgot the endianess again.
Image 14 was me correcting that and that was the key to unlock the door as shown in Image 15.
