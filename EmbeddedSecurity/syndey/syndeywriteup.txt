Moving onto the next challenge.
If you look into Image 1, you will see there is a line that says they found out that 
people were hacking into the lock because the password was in the memory. 
So, they removed it from memory, or at least they said they did.
The first thing I did was check the code and in Image 2, you will see 
highlighted 3 comparision instructions to r15, which we established in New Orleans is where the password is held.
Since that is what is compared that must be the password, right?
Image 3 is telling you what the hex converts to in ascii. 
However, if you put that ascii in as the password as shown in Image 8. 
You will see in Image 9-11 that it will output that it is incorrect. That is because of the endianess of the hex.
The computer reads the hex different than you the user. 
In Image 7 you see that for each grouping of 4 I change the order as in if the hex was ABCD it would become CDAB for the endianess of the lock. 
Image 4 enters that corrected version in and Image 5-6 shows that it passes where the previous password would fail.
So, we finish the Syndey challenge.
