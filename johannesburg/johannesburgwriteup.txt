Moving onto the next challenge.

For once, we did not need to read the instructions in Imgae 1. 
Firstly, I checked testing_password_valid and found it to be the same. 
Then I looked at what was occuring in Image 2-3. 
Image 4 was when I saw that again the password was stored with the instructions. 
I checked to see in Image 5-6 if the legnth would matter if it was too long 
and saw in Image 7 that it checked that hex 3e still existed in the memory. 
I inputted it as well as the hex for unlocking the door which was at address 4446, as shown in Image 8. 
It did not work so I added 3e3e to see if it needed to be size of 4 and that worked.
