For challenge 3, I was not able to figure out how to 
properly calculate the frequency of the letters since it was a bit confusing for me.
I decided to go a different route and use lamba's to score the letters all differently.
Then after scoring each one, I would use a loop to xor each byte to see for each key what the xor would show.
Once that was done I printed the answer because that is what they wanted.
